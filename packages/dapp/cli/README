CLI Scripts

These scripts are intended for arbitrators doing offline operations. 

They should be run by the owner of the Arbitrator contract. This should have been set after deployment by the deployer, eg with:

truffle console
> Arbitrator.deployed().then(function(a){ arb=a;} )
> arb.transferOwnership("0x8f6981b7d32eacf7d2169ca29cb8a8864131403d")

The Network ID on which they will be used and other parameters can be set in the config.json file.

Since they are intended to be offline, the scripts require you to manually pass in the nonce and gas price, rather than getting these automatically from the network. The nonce and gas price passed as parameters are sanity-checked based on settings in config.json. These settings may need to be adjusted.

The arbitrator's private key should be stored in the secrets directory, in the file specified in config.json. This is excluded from version control.

The scripts are:

* set_reality_check.js: Sets the default Reality Check contract
* set_dispute_fee.js: Sets the default dispute fee 
* set_question_fee.js: Sets the question fee (we will probably initially leave this at 0, but it may become necessary if network fees drop and the list of open questions gets spammed.)
* call_withdraw.js: Withdraws any accumulated question fees from the arbitrator's balance in the Reality Check contract to the Arbitrator contract
* withdraw.js: Withdraws any balance held by the arbitrator contract to the designated address
* arbitrate.js: Signs an arbitration transaction. Expects that the data it should sign will be in a file under requests/arbitration.json, so you only need to pass in its ID.

For usage information, run the script without parameters, eg node set_dispute_fee.js
