/**
 * A signer interface that potentially modifies the provided {@link Transaction | Transactions}
 * before signing them.
 *
 * For instance, this enables wallets to inject additional instructions into the
 * transaction before signing them. For each transaction, instead of returning a
 * {@link SignatureDictionary}, its
 * {@link TransactionModifyingSigner#modifyAndSignTransactions | modifyAndSignTransactions} function
 * returns an updated {@link Transaction} with a potentially modified set of instructions and
 * signature dictionary. The returned transaction must be within the transaction size limit,
 * and include a `lifetimeConstraint`.
 *
 * @typeParam TAddress - Supply a string literal to define a signer having a particular address.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const signer: TransactionModifyingSigner<'1234..5678'> = {
 *     address: address('1234..5678'),
 *     modifyAndSignTransactions: async (
 *         transactions: Transaction[]
 *     ): Promise<(Transaction & TransactionWithinSizeLimit & TransactionWithLifetime)[]> => {
 *         // My custom signing logic.
 *     },
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * Here are the main characteristics of this signer interface:
 *
 * - **Sequential**. Contrary to partial signers, these cannot be executed in
 *   parallel as each call can modify the provided transactions.
 * - **First signers**. For a given transaction, a modifying signer must always
 *   be used before a partial signer as the former will likely modify the
 *   transaction and thus impact the outcome of the latter.
 * - **Potential conflicts**. If more than one modifying signer is provided,
 *   the second signer may invalidate the signature of the first one. However,
 *   modifying signers may decide not to modify a transaction based on the
 *   existence of signatures for that transaction.
