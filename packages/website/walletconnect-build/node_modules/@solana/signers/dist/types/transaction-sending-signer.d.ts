/**
 * A signer interface that signs one or multiple transactions
 * before sending them immediately to the blockchain.
 *
 * It defines a {@link TransactionSendingSignerConfig#signAndSendTransactions | signAndSendTransactions}
 * function that returns the transaction signature (i.e. its identifier) for each provided
 * {@link Transaction}.
 *
 * This interface is required for PDA wallets and other types of wallets that don't provide an
 * interface for signing transactions without sending them.
 *
 * Note that it is also possible for such signers to modify the provided transactions
 * before signing and sending them. This enables use cases where the modified transactions
 * cannot be shared with the app and thus must be sent directly.
 *
 * @typeParam TAddress - Supply a string literal to define a signer having a particular address.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const myTransactionSendingSigner: TransactionSendingSigner<'1234..5678'> = {
 *     address: address('1234..5678'),
 *     signAndSendTransactions: async (transactions: Transaction[]): Promise<SignatureBytes[]> => {
 *         // My custom signing logic.
 *     },
 * };
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * Here are the main characteristics of this signer interface:
 *
 * - **Single signer**. Since this signer also sends the provided transactions,
 *   we can only use a single {@link TransactionSendingSigner} for a given set of transactions.
 * - **Last signer**. Trivially, that signer must also be the last one used.
 * - **Potential conflicts**. Since signers may decide to modify the given
 *   transactions before sending them, they may invalidate previous signatures.
 *   However, signers may decide not to modify a transaction based
 *   on the existence of signatures for that transaction.
 * - **Potential confirmation**. Whilst this is not required by this interface,
 *   it is also worth noting that most wallets will also wait for the transaction
 *   to be confirmed (typically with a `confirmed` commitment)
 *   before notifying the app that they are done.
